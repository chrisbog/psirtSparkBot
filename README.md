# psirtSparkBot

This BOT is designed to work with the Cisco Spark Solution. It is a very simple example that allows a user to query PSIRT Data from Cisco's Public API.

## Requirements
This solution is currently designed to be deployed on the Cisco Mantl solution.   However, since it leverages a standard Docker container, any container hosting solution can be used.

The owner will also be required to register for access to the Cisco API Console and specifically the Cisco PSIRT openVuln API.
